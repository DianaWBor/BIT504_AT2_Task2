TicTacToeGame

Experiment_2 has completelety overhauled the files and consolidated all classes into one file : GameMain.java

As mentioned in the experiment_1 readme file,deciphering and updating source files hase been tremendously hard as the previous programmer's preferred syntax is one i am unfamiliar with. I am familiar with a different syntax which still achieves the same outcome and objective of the original code(to make a tic tac toe gui app).


i have overhauled most of the syntax replacing it with button interface for the cells. I have done this while retaining some syntax as well retaining the same functionality and methodology as the original file. For example the code in line 64 t0 164 in the GameMain.java file in this branch is essentially the same as found in line 44 to 55 of the Board.java file in experiment_1,  but rather than rows and columns it has a button interface. Because every single winning combination on buttons has to be explicitly stated for there is so much more code in this branch's execution of this winning method than in the Board.java method in experiment_1.

CONCLUSION

I have formatted it to my style as a programmer which is a tKinter(python) type gui, with button interfaces and method execution ending in dialogue and message boxes
