TicTacToeGame

Experiment_1 has the following changes implemented;

Board.java : 
line 1: connected file to the ticTacToe package 
line 44 : wrote code to check if the player has 3 in the playerCol.
line 55 : wrote code to check if the player has diagonal in the other direction
 
Cell.java :
line 1: connected file to the ticTacToe package 

GameMain.java :

line 1: connected file to the ticTacToe package 
line 14: added serialVersionUID = 4988394812976214413L
line 36: created GameState enum
line 86-105: set the default close operation to exit on close
line 86-105: created GameMain game panel and added it to the frame

 
Player.java :

line 1: connected file to the ticTacToe package 


As a result the program now displays a GUI when run which it did not before.
Overall the code is taking very long to decipher and update, and its hard to understand how the methods and classes connect 
based on the comments alone.
